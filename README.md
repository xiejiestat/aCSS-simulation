# aCSS-simulation

This repository provides simulation code for **Approximate Co-Sufficient Sampling (aCSS)**, a novel resampling framework for generating synthetic copies and conducting statistical inference.

The implementation is intended to support the experimental results in our accompanying paper and to facilitate reproducibility and further methodological development.
