# A Generalized Framework for Approximate Co-Sufficient Sampling

This repository contains simulation code for **Approximate Co-Sufficient Sampling (aCSS)**, a generalized resampling framework for constructing synthetic copies and performing statistical inference.

The code is designed to reproduce the simulation results in the accompanying paper and to serve as a reference implementation for further research and extensions.
